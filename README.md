**SAL League Operations Platform**

A lightweight competition operations platform for the SAL league. This is not a Discord bot — Discord is the workflow intake layer. The system is a full operations stack: match lifecycle management, evidence collection, admin approval pipelines, OCR-assisted stat extraction, and compliance-grade audit logging.

---

## Platform Identity

This platform exists to solve three operational problems:

1. **Accountability** — every match result, reschedule, and admin action must be traceable, attributable, and recoverable.
2. **Compliance** — Hi-Rez tournament and prizing requirements demand timestamped evidence, screenshot archives, and auditable receipts.
3. **Scale** — manual Discord moderation does not scale. Structured workflows reduce admin cognitive load and surface the right information at the right time.

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Supabase** | Authoritative state. Owns all entities, relationships, lifecycle, identifiers. |
| **Discord Bot** | Workflow intake. Captain commands, public receipts, admin review cards, proof threads. |
| **Website** | Operational control center. Complex edits, audit history, stat review, corrections. |
| **ForgeLens** | OCR processor. Extracts stats from screenshots, generates confidence scores, creates pending stat records for review. |

**Discord is not a database. Supabase is.**

## Why Not a Bot

Standard Discord bots process messages and react to events. This platform uses Discord as a structured form-entry and receipt-delivery surface. The actual state of the league — matches, schedules, standings, player stats — lives entirely in Supabase. Discord posts are receipts, not records.

This distinction matters for:

- **Recovery** — if the bot restarts, no data is lost. Supabase has everything.
- **Auditability** — every change is traceable regardless of Discord message history.
- **Correctness** — dropdown-driven match selection eliminates typos and fuzzy matching ambiguity.
- **Compliance** — public Discord posts become timestamped evidence archives, not the source of truth.

---

## Core Workflows

### `/report-result`

Captain selects eligible match from Supabase-driven dropdown → enters winner + score → system creates:

1. Public embed in `#match-results-[division]`
2. Dedicated proof thread for screenshot upload
3. Admin review card in `#admin-review`
4. Pending action in Supabase
5. Audit log entry

Screenshots are uploaded to the proof thread, not inline to the command. This supports 6–10 screenshots per match without degrading UX.

### `/reschedule`

Captain selects scheduled match → requests new date/time → admin review workflow triggered.

### `/request-admin-review`

Catch-all escalation. Creates an admin review card for any issue not covered by structured commands.

---

## Command Philosophy

**Commands are the official workflow. Message scanning is the safety net.**

Captains are expected to use slash commands. The bot may optionally scan channels for fallback detection, but scanned messages never become authoritative without a corresponding pending action processed through the normal pipeline.

This means:
- Every legitimate action has a corresponding `pending_actions` record.
- Admins always review before mutations occur.
- No state changes happen silently.

---

## Evidence System

Every actionable command produces two posts:

| Post | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Public receipt | `#match-results-[division]` or `#reschedules-[division]` | Transparency, compliance, prizing verification |
| Admin review card | `#admin-review` | Triage, approval, workflow actions |

Proof threads attached to match reports:
- Track screenshot upload progress (`0/6 uploaded → 4/6 → ✅ complete`)
- Are monitored by ForgeLens for OCR processing
- Are stored as evidence references in Supabase Storage

---

## Status Emoji Semantics

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 📝 | Received / under review |
| 📸 | Awaiting proof upload |
| ⚠️ | Needs info |
| ✅ | Approved |
| ❌ | Denied |
| 🔁 | Revised |

---

## OCR Pipeline

ForgeLens watches proof threads, processes screenshots through OCR, and generates pending stat records with confidence scores. **OCR never directly mutates official stats.** Every extracted stat passes through admin review before it becomes official.

```
Screenshot uploaded
→ ForgeLens OCR
→ Confidence score generated
→ Pending stat record created
→ Admin review / manual correction
→ Official stat written
```

## Operational Goals

- **Zero silent mutations** — every state change is logged to `audit_logs`.
- **Human-in-the-loop approvals** — no automated approval of match results or stat records.
- **Recovery by default** — every action is reversible or correctable via the website panel.
- **Compliance-grade receipts** — public Discord posts constitute Hi-Rez acceptable evidence archives.
- **Multi-league ready** — all entities are scoped by `division_id`. Adding a new league requires no schema changes.
