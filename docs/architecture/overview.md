# Architecture Overview

## System Design

The SAL operations platform is a four-component system. Each component has a distinct and non-overlapping responsibility. Blurring these boundaries is the most common source of operational bugs.

## Components

### Supabase

**Role:** Authoritative state.

Supabase owns everything that matters:

- Match records and lifecycle
- Schedules and divisions
- Player/team relationships
- Standings
- Pending actions
- Audit logs
- Evidence references
- OCR stat records
- Proof thread metadata

Supabase is the system of record. No other component is allowed to be the "real" source of any entity.

### Discord Bot

**Role:** Workflow intake UI.

The bot handles:

- Captain slash commands (intake forms)
- Public receipt embeds (league-facing evidence posts)
- Proof thread creation and management
- Admin review card posting
- Approval button interaction handling
- Screenshot upload tracking

The bot does **not** store state. It reads from Supabase and writes back to Supabase. It uses Discord as a display surface.

### Website

**Role:** Operational control center.

The website handles:

- Admin review queue (full view, not just quick triage)
- Complex match edits and corrections
- Score relinking
- Stat review and manual correction
- Audit history browsing
- Standings display
- Player and team pages
- Admin override capabilities

The website is where detailed work happens. Discord is where fast triage happens.

### ForgeLens

**Role:** OCR processor.

ForgeLens:

- Watches proof threads for new screenshots
- Processes images through OCR pipeline
- Extracts player stats
- Assigns confidence scores
- Creates `pending_stat_records` for admin review

ForgeLens never directly writes to official stats. It produces pending records only.

## Data Flow

### Match Report Flow

```
Captain: /report-result
→ Bot validates captain, fetches eligible matches from Supabase
→ Captain selects match from dropdown
→ Bot creates pending_action (type: match_result)
→ Bot posts public receipt embed in #match-results-[division]
→ Bot creates proof thread under the receipt embed
→ Bot posts admin review card in #admin-review
→ Bot writes audit log entry
→ Captain uploads screenshots to proof thread
→ ForgeLens processes screenshots → pending_stat_records
→ Admin reviews pending_action
→ Admin approves → match.status = completed, winner/score written
→ Audit log records mutation with actor, old value, new value
```

### Reschedule Flow

```
Captain: /reschedule
→ Bot validates captain, fetches eligible matches
→ Captain selects match + proposes new time
→ Bot creates pending_action (type: reschedule)
→ Bot posts public receipt in #reschedules-[division]
→ Bot posts admin review card in #admin-review
→ Admin approves → match.scheduled_at mutated
→ Audit log records mutation
```

## Approval Pipeline

All approvals use the same infrastructure. There is one approval pipeline, not one per workflow type.

Admin review cards support four actions:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|---------|
| **Approve** | Executes the mutation. Writes audit log. Updates Discord embeds. |
| **Deny** | Marks pending_action as denied. Updates Discord embeds. Optional admin note. |
| **Needs Info** | Marks pending_action as pending_info. Updates embeds with ⚠️. |
| **Open Admin Panel** | Deep links to the website control center with full context. |

---

## Multi-League Design

All entities carry a `division_id`. The schema supports multiple concurrent divisions without structural changes. Adding a new division means inserting a new `divisions` row and configuring the corresponding Discord channels.

## Failure Modes and Recovery

| Failure | Impact | Recovery |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Bot offline | No new commands processed | Bot restart; pending_actions already in Supabase are not lost |
| Discord message deleted | Receipt lost from Discord | Evidence still in Supabase Storage and audit logs |
| Failed OCR | Stats not extracted | Retry via admin panel; manual stat entry available |
| Bad approval | Incorrect match mutation | Correction via website admin panel; audit log preserved |
| Supabase outage | Full system halt | No state loss; bot reconnects on restore |
