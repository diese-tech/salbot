# Admin Operations Runbook

Common admin tasks and how to perform them correctly.

---

## Approving a Match Result

**Via Discord:**
1. Locate the pending review card in `#admin-review`
2. Verify the match details (week, teams, score) match expectation
3. Check proof thread link — verify screenshot count is reasonable
4. Press **Approve**
5. Bot updates public receipt to ✅ and disables review card buttons

**Via Website:**
1. Navigate to Admin → Review Queue
2. Filter by type: `match_result`
3. Open the pending action
4. Review match details, proof thread link, screenshot count
5. Click Approve
6. System executes same mutation as Discord approval

---

## Denying a Match Result

1. Open review card (Discord or website)
2. Press **Deny**
3. Enter reason (required)
4. Captain is notified in the proof thread
5. Captain may re-submit via `/report-result`

---

## Requesting More Information

1. Press **⚠️ Needs Info** on the review card
2. Enter the specific information needed (e.g., "Please re-upload screenshots — they appear to be from the wrong match")
3. Captain is pinged in the proof thread with the note
4. When captain has responded, return to the review card and approve or deny

## Correcting a Score After Approval

Only use this if a score was approved incorrectly.

1. Navigate to Admin → Matches → [Match ID]
2. Click "Admin Override"
3. Enter corrected score and winner
4. Enter a reason (required — this is a compliance record)
5. System writes `audit_log { action_type: 'admin_override', note: [reason] }`
6. Original approved action remains in audit log — this is correct

---

## Linking a Player to an OCR Record

When ForgeLens extracts stats but cannot match the in-game name to a player:

1. Navigate to Admin → Stats → Pending Review
2. Filter by `player_id IS NULL`
3. For each unlinked record, search for the player by display name or Discord handle
4. Select the matching player
5. Approve the record

---

## Manually Entering Stats

When a screenshot is unreadable or ForgeLens has failed:

1. Navigate to Admin → Matches → [Match ID] → Stat Entry
2. Select the player
3. Enter stats manually
4. Submit — creates a `pending_stat_record` with `source = 'manual'`, `confidence = 1.0`
5. Approve via normal review flow

---

## Viewing Audit History for a Match

1. Navigate to Admin → Matches → [Match ID] → Audit History
2. Full timeline of all events: pending action created, approved, stats extracted, stats approved, any overrides

This view is the authoritative record for any dispute.

## Correcting a Player's Team Assignment

1. Navigate to Admin → Players → [Player]
2. Click Edit
3. Change `team_id`
4. Add a note (reason for change)
5. System writes audit log entry

This does not retroactively change historical match records. If matches need to be re-attributed, that is a separate admin override on each affected match.
