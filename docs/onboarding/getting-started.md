# Getting Started

Welcome to the SAL operations platform. This guide covers what you need to know to contribute.

## What You're Working On

This is not a Discord bot project. It is a competition operations platform. The Discord bot is one component of four. Before writing code, read:

1. [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](../architecture/overview.md) — system design and component responsibilities
2. [`docs/operational-philosophy.md`](../operational-philosophy.md) — founding principles
3. [`docs/architecture/platform-split.md`](../architecture/platform-split.md) — what belongs where
4. [`docs/database/mutation-patterns.md`](../database/mutation-patterns.md) — how state changes are made

If you are adding a new feature that touches the approval pipeline, audit logs, or OCR pipeline, read the relevant ADR in [`docs/adrs/`](../adrs/) first.

## Key Concepts

### pending_actions

Every captain command creates a `pending_action`. No match mutation happens without one. If you're adding a new workflow, it must produce a `pending_action`. See [`docs/workflows/approval-pipeline.md`](../workflows/approval-pipeline.md).

### audit_logs

Every mutation writes an `audit_log` entry. This is not optional. If your code changes a match, player stat, or standing and does not write to `audit_logs`, it is a bug. See [`docs/database/audit-philosophy.md`](../database/audit-philosophy.md).

### match selection dropdowns

Captains do not type team names. The bot resolves the captain's identity, finds their team, and shows a dropdown of eligible matches from Supabase. This avoids typos and fuzzy matching. Your command handlers should follow this pattern.

## First PR Checklist

- [ ] Does my change touch the approval pipeline? → Read the pipeline ADRs.
- [ ] Does my change mutate a match, player_stat, or standing? → Does it write to `audit_logs`?
- [ ] Does my change add a new command? → Does it produce a `pending_action`?
- [ ] Does my change add a new pending_action type? → Does it have an approval handler?
- [ ] Have I added tests for the new approval path?
